Athletes who are subject to anti-doping rules would need a TUE to take a prohibited substance or use a prohibited method. You should verify with your NADO to know to whom you need to apply and if you can apply retroactively.

First, check if the required medication or method you intend to take or use is prohibited as per the [WADA Prohibited List](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list). You can also check with your NADO if there is a reliable local source to check or you can check at [Global DRO](https://www.globaldro.com/Home). However, do note that Global DRO will not have your local registered drugs.

You have a responsibility to inform your physician(s) that you are an Athlete bound to anti-doping rules. You and your physician(s) should check the Prohibited List for whatever substance/method you are prescribed. If the substance/method is prohibited, discuss non-prohibited alternatives, if there are none, apply for a TUE. Remember athletes have the ultimate responsibility. Contact your NADO if you are having difficulties. 

Second, contact your NADO to determine your competition level and TUE application requirements.

**If you are an International-Level Athlete¹**, you are required to submit your TUE application to your International Federation (IF). Your respective IFs are responsible for accepting applications and granting/refusing TUEs.

Athletes competing in Major Events should consult the Major Events Organisation (MEO) on the TUE application process and determine if their pre-existing TUE is recognised by the MEO.

Athletes must not submit TUE Applications to more than one organisation.

TUEs granted by a MEO will only be valid during the duration of the event. A TUE granted by a NADO or an IF is not valid for the event unless it is recognised by the MEO, although it is valid outside of that event.

Therefore, it is your responsibility to check if the respective NADO’s TUE granted is recognised by the relevant IF or MEO (see [section 7.1 of ISTUE](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/international-standard-therapeutic-use-exemptions-istue)). Your NADO can assist you in the determination of your level and TUE application requirements, and, should the need occur, assist you in presenting your NADO’s TUE to an IF for recognition.

**If it is determined that you are a National-Level Athlete²**, you must apply to your respective NADO in advance, as soon as the need arises, unless there are emergency or exceptional circumstances.

For substances prohibited in-competition only, you should apply for a TUE at least 30 days before your next competition. Please refer to the section “How to apply for a TUE?” for detailed information.

**If you are neither an International-Level nor National-Level Athlete**, you are entitled to apply for a retroactive TUE after being tested by your NADO or any other Anti-Doping Organisation (ADO).

> *Important note: A TUE granted by your NADO is only valid at the national level. If you are, or become an International-Level Athlete, or compete at Major Games, that TUE will not be valid unless it is recognised by the relevant International Federation (IF) or Major Event Organization (MEO). It is your responsibility to check if your your NADO’s TUE is automatically recognised by such IF or MEO.*
