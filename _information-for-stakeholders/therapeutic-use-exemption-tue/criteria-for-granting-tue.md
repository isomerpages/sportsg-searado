In some instances, there may not be alternative medication or method to treat an illness or medical condition. TUEs ensure that the athlete is able to obtain the best treatment for a legitimate medical condition, even if treatment requires a prohibited substance or method. With the authorisation to consume the needed medication, it avoids the risk of sanctions if a positive test were to be detected.

All of the four following criteria must be met (for more details, please refer to the [WADA International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (ISTUE) Article 4.2](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/international-standard-therapeutic-use-exemptions-istue#resource-download):
1. The athlete has a clear diagnosed medical condition which requires treatment using a prohibited substance or method;
2. The therapeutic use of the substance would not produce significant enhancement of performance beyond the athleteâ€™s normal state of health;
3. The prohibited substance or method is an indicated treatment for the medical condition, and there is no reasonable permitted therapeutic alternative; and
4. The necessity to use that substance or method is not the consequence of the prior use (without a TUE), of a substance or method which was prohibited at the time of use.
