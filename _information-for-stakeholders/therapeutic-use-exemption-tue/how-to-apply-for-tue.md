##### Check with your NADO on the application process.

NADOs can also download the [TUE Application Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9g3pbhlTR3CgWk-aJ8H4aJxhkFiIq-n/view?usp=sharing) and customise the form for your needs.

Athletes are to note that your TUE application must be submitted in a legible form using capital letters or typing.

The medical file includes:
- A comprehensive medical history, including documentation from the original diagnosing physician(s) (where possible); and
- The results of all examinations, laboratory investigations and imaging studies relevant to the application.

Any TUE application that is not complete or legible will not be dealt with and will be returned for completion and re-submission.

To assist you and your doctor in providing the correct medical documentation, we suggest consulting the [WADAâ€™s Checklists for TUE applications](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/search?q=Checklist%20for%20TUE%20applications&filters%5Bcontent_type%5D%5B%5D=%22resource%22) for guidance and support during the TUE application process, and [Medical Information to Support the Decisions of TUECs](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/search?q=Medical%20information%20to%20support%20the%20decision%20of%20the%20TUEC&filters%5Bcontent_type%5D%5B%5D=%22resource%22) for guidance on specific common medical conditions, treatments, substances, etc.

Keep a completed copy of the TUE application form and all medical information submitted in support of your application, and proof that it has been sent.

##### What if my NADO's TUE is NOT Recognised by my IF?
You or your NADO have **21 days** to refer the matter to WADA for review after the decision was rendered by the TUEC by sending the same information that you submitted to your TUEC and on which they based their decision to deny the TUE via registered mail at:
