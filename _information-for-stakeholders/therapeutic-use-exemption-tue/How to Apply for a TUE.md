##### [Note: The NADO choose only one option (1 or 2)]

**Option 1 - only through ADAMS**

You must exclusively submit your TUE application, including the required medical file, via ADAMS. If you do not have an ADAMS account yet, please contact your NADO to have your account set up.


**Option 2 – through ADAMS or paper format / electronic TUE form**

You are encouraged by your NADO to submit TUE applications via ADAMS, together with the required medical file. If you do not have an ADAMS account yet, please contact your NADO to have it set up.


Otherwise, please download the [TUE application form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v878NC_znUw-47HxBAbg-9JcOR3GWdX/view?usp=drive_link), and once duly completed and signed, send it together with the required medical file to your NADO.

Your TUE application must be submitted in a legible form using capital letters or typing.

The medical file includes:
- A comprehensive medical history, including documentation from the original diagnosing physician(s) (where possible), and
- The results of all examinations, laboratory investigations and imaging studies relevant to the application.

Any TUE application that is not complete or legible will not be dealt with and will be returned for completion and re-submission.

To assist you and your doctor in providing the correct medical documentation, we suggest consulting the WADA’s [Checklists for TUE applications](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/search?q=Checklists%20for%20TUE%20Applications&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%5D%5B%5D=%22resource%22) for guidance and support during the TUE application process, and [TUE Physcial Guidelines](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/search?q=TUE%20Physician%20Guidelines&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%5D%5B%5D=%22resource%22) for guidance on specific common medical conditions, treatments, substances, etc. 

Keep a completed copy of the TUE application form and all medical information submitted in support of your application, and proof that it has been sent.

##### What if my NADO's TUE is NOT Recognised by my IF?
You or your NADO have **21 days** to refer the matter to WADA for review after the decision was rendered by the TUEC by sending the same information that you submitted to your TUEC and on which they based their decision to deny the TUE via registered mail at:
