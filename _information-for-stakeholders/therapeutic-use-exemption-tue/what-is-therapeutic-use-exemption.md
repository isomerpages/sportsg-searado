Athletes may have illnesses or conditions that require them to take particular medications or undergo procedures. If the medication or method an athlete is required to take/use to treat an illness or condition is included in the [World Anti-Doping Agencyâ€™s (WADA) Prohibited List (2021)](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2021list_en.pdf), a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) may give that athlete the right to take a substance or use a method that is prohibited.

Applications for TUEs are reviewed by a panel of independent medical experts, the TUE Committee (TUEC) who may grant such permission.
