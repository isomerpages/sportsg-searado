*First*, check if the medication or method you intend to take or use appears on the Prohibited List. You can also check with your NADO if there is a reliable local source to check or you can check at globaldro.com. However, do note that [Global DRO](https://www.globaldro.com/Home) will not have your local registered drugs.

You have the responsibility to inform your doctors that you are an athlete subject to doping control, and your doctors should check the Prohibited List whenever they prescribe a medication / method to you. If the substance / method is prohibited, check with your doctors if there are any alternative treatments that are not prohibited. If not, you have to apply for a TUE.

*Second*, check your competition level to determine to which organization, and when to apply for a TUE.

**If you are an International-Level Athlete**, you are required to submit your TUE application to your International Federation (IF). Your respective IFs are responsible for accepting applications and granting/refusing TUEs.

Athletes competing in Major Events should consult the Major Events Organisation (MEO) on the TUE application process and determine if their pre-existing TUE is recognised by the MEO.

Athletes must not submit TUE Applications to more than one organisation.

TUEs granted by a MEO will only be valid during the duration of the event. A TUE granted by a NADO or an IF is not valid for the event unless it is recognised by the MEO, although it is valid outside of that event.

Therefore, it is your responsibility to check if the respective NADO’s TUE granted is recognised by the relevant IF or MEO (see section 7.1 of ISTUE). Your NADO can assist you in the determination of your level and TUE application requirements, and, should the need occur, assist you in presenting your NADO’s TUE to an IF for recognition.

**If you are a National-Level Athlete**, you must apply to your respective NADO in advance, as soon as the need arises, unless there are emergency or exceptional circumstances.

For substances prohibited in-competition only, you should apply for a TUE at least 30 days before your next competition. Please refer to the section “How to apply for a TUE?” for detailed information.

**If you are neither an International-Level nor National-Level Athlete**, and are using a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method for therapeutic reasons, your respective NADO may permit you to apply for a retroactive TUE (see [section 4.1.D of ISTUE](/information-for-stakeholders/2021-istue-4.1.d.pdf).

> *Important note: A TUE granted by your respective NADO is not valid at the international level, unless recognized by the governing IF or MEO.*
