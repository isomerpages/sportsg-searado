#### **About Results Management**
The Anti-Doping Organisation (ADO) that initiated sample collection is responsible for results management.

The WADA-accredited laboratory that analyses the A sample will report the results to the ADO responsible for results management and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

##### There are three possible results:
**A Negative Result** – No presence of prohibited substances or methods.

**An Atypical Finding** – Some prohibited substances are produced naturally in the body (endogenous). The presence of such substances outside what is considered to be a normal range in the A sample may result in the laboratory reporting an atypical finding.

**An Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF)** – The presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers (including elevated quantities of endogenous substances) or evidence of the use of a prohibited method.
