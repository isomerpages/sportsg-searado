#### **What are the sanctions for Anti-doping Rule Violations (ADRVs)?**
Sanctions for violating anti-doping regulations may range from a reprimand to a lifetime ban. The period of ineligibility may vary depending on the type of anti-doping violation, the circumstances of an individual case, the substance, and the possible repetition of an anti-doping rule violation.

For in-competition testing, this will also automatically include disqualification of results obtained in that competition, and forfeiture of any medals, points, and/or prizes. All results of any competitions following the collection of the sample may also be disqualified.

Athletes have the right to appeal any decisions made by the independent disciplinary panel or an alternative hearing body. Depending on the status of the athlete, the appeal may be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) or an applicable Appeals body.

Other ADOs or WADA also have the right to appeal a decision regarding the case. In such an instance, the procedure remains the same and the athlete has the right to be heard during the proceedings.
