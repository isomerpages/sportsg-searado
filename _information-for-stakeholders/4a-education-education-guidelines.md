Education Guidelines & Information outline current, accurate, practical information to help protect clean sport and ensure compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code. These documents ensure stakeholders have the information they need, so that they can abide by anti-doping rules and regulations.

##### Education and Information Guidelines
[The Guidelines](/information-for-stakeholders/2021-ise.pdf) support ADOs in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of an effective core education program within a broader anti-doping program that also actively addresses deterrence and detection. Concrete examples are included to put concepts and principles into context. Worksheets and plans help with program development.

##### Research Package for Anti-Doping Organizations
[The Research Package](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/wada_social_science_research_package_ado.pdf) provides a standardized method of measuring athletes' responses to important issues in anti-doping. This helps assess the effectiveness of education programs and allows for comparisons between athlete populations around the globe.

##### A Handbook for the Evaluation of Anti-Doping Education Package
[The Evaluation Handbook](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/houlihan_final_report.pdf) is designed to help anti-doping organizations (ADOs) to develop a framework for their education programs and provide guidance on how best to monitor and evaluate these programs. This will help ADOs determine how effective their programs are, how to improve them, and illustrate the importance of education and prevention within a broader anti-doping program.
