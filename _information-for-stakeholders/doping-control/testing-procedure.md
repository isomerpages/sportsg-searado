The following are the various steps of The Doping Control Process:

**1. Athlete Selection**

Athletes can be selected for testing at anytime and anywhere.

**2. Notification**

A Doping Control Officer (DCO) or Chaperone will notify the selected athlete and inform the athlete of his/her rights and responsibilities. 

**3. Reporting to the Doping Control Station**

The athlete should report immediately for the doping control test. The DCO may allow a delay in reporting under circumstances such as attending a press conference or victory ceremony, and completing a training session.

**4. Selecting the Sample Collection Vessel** 

The athlete will be given a few individually sealed sample collection vessels to select from. It is important to ensure that the packaging is intact and that the vessel is free of contaminant.

**5. Provision of the Sample**

When the athlete is ready to provide with the sample, the athlete will be accompanied by a DCO or chaperone of the same gender to the toilet. The athlete should wash his/her hands, disrobe from knees to chest and from hands to elbow to provide an unobstructed view of the passing of the sample to the DCO or chaperone. A minimum of 90 ml of urine is needed for a complete sample. The athlete may also be asked to provide a blood sample during the same doping control session.

**6. Selecting the Sample Collection Kit**

Athletes will be offered a choice of sealed sample collection equipment (which includes A Sample and B Sample bottles), and should check they have not been tampered with.

**7. Dividing and Sealing the Sample** 

The athlete will divide the sample between the A Sample and B Sample bottles, and then tightly fasten the bottles. The B Sample bottle should contain at least 30 ml of urine and the rest can be poured into the A Sample bottle. The bottle will then need to be sealed in plastic bags and placed into the storage box. The athlete can provide consent for his/her representative or the DCO to assist, if required. A small amount of urine should be left in the collection vessel for the DCO to measure the specific gravity.

**8. Testing the Suitability of the Sample**

The DCO will check the Specific Gravity of the sample to ensure it is not too diluted for analysis. If the sample is too diluted, the DCO will record this on the doping control form and request additional samples to be provided until one that is within the required range for Specific Gravity is provided, or until the DCO determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, the session should end.

**9. Completing the Doping Control Form (DCF)** 

The athlete will complete the DCF by:

1. Declaring any medication or supplements taken during the past 7 days
2. Providing details of any Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE)
3. Noting any comments about the doping control procedures
4. Confirming the information on the doping control form are correct
5. Ensuring the laboratory copy of the form does not contain any information that will identify the athlete
6. Signing and receiving a copy of the DCF

**10. The Laboratory Process**

All collected samples will be packaged and sent to a WADA-accredited laboratory for analysis. The transportation will be monitored by chain of custody procedures to ensure the security of the samples and that the samples can be tracked.

#### **Modifications for Minors and Athletes with Disability**
An athlete who is a minor or an athlete with a disability may require slight modifications to the sample collection procedure.

##### Minors
Minors must be notified in the presence of an adult, who could be the athlete’s coach or manager, another member of Doping Control Personnel, or a representative from a National Sports Federation. The athlete may be accompanied by an athlete representative at all times during the sample collection procedure, including in the washroom area during sample provision. However, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample. If the athlete decides not to have a representative, the DCO may ask a third party to be present.

##### Athletes with Disability
Athletes with a __physical disability__, or have restricted mobility or manual dexterity may ask an adult athlete representative or the DCO to assist when handling the sample collection equipment, splitting of the sample, or completing the DCF. The representative may complete the required sections of the DCF and sign the form on the athlete’s behalf if the athlete is unable to do so.

Athletes with a __visual impairment__ must be accompanied by an adult athlete representative at all times during notification and the sample collection procedure, including in the washroom area during sample provision. However, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample. The representative must read the contents of the DCF to the athlete, and the athlete may ask the representative to make any comments on the DCF on his/her behalf, if necessary.

Athletes with an __intellectual disability__ must be accompanied by an adult athlete representative at all times during notification and the sample collection procedure, including in the washroom area during sample provision. However, the representative will not witness the passing of the sample. The representative may read the contents of the DCF to the athlete if required.

Athletes using condom drainage or indwelling catheter drainage should remove the existing collection bag and drain the system so that a fresh sample can be obtained.

Athletes who self-catheterize may use their own catheter to provide a sample (this catheter should be in a tamper-evident packaging), or use one provided by the DCO if available.
