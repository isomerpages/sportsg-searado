Education Guidelines &amp; Information outline current, accurate, practical information to help protect clean sport and ensure compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code. These documents ensure stakeholders have the information they need, so that they can abide by anti-doping rules and regulations.
##### International Standard for Education (ISE) 
Education, as one prevention strategy highlighted in the Code, seeks to promote behaviour in line with the values of clean sport and to help prevent Athletes and other Persons from doping. 
<br> One key underpinning principles of the ISE is that an Athlete's first experience with anti-doping should be through Education rather than Doping Control.

##### Education and Information Guidelines
[The Guidelines](/files/information-for-stakeholders/educationguideline.pdf) support ADOs in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of an effective core education programme within a broader anti-doping programme that also actively addresses deterrence and detection. Concrete examples are included to put concepts and principles into context. Worksheets and plans help with programme development.

##### Research Package for Anti-Doping Organizations
[The Research Package](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/wada_social_science_research_package_ado.pdf) provides a standardised method of measuring athletes' responses to important issues in anti-doping. This helps assess the effectiveness of education programmes and allows for comparisons between athlete populations around the globe.

##### Overview and Guidance for Applicants to WADA Social Science Research Grant Program
Social Science Research (SSR) is an integral part of the anti-doping system. Using SSR to better understand doping as a human behavior helps support the prevention model that underpins the anti-doping system, which is built around rule of law, education, deterrence, detection, and enforcement. WADA is committed to SSR, demonstrated through its investment in the Grant Program since 2005 and the success of the [2020-2024 SSR Strategy](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/social-science-research-strategy-2020-2024). This commitment will continue into the future with the development of a new strategy already underway.

The Grant Program is key to ensuring a continued investment in research so that anti-doping programs can be designed using an evidence-based approach. Through the Grant Program, WADA awards research grants to organizations of all types (such as universities, colleges, small businesses, for-profit, and not-for-profit organizations). 

The application process for the [2025 SSR Grant Program](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/news/wada-launches-call-proposals-2025-social-science-research-grant-program) closed on the 18 of November 2024. Do check in regularly for any latest updates on the 2026 Program. 

##### A Handbook for the Evaluation of Anti-Doping Education Package
[The Evaluation Handbook](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/houlihan_final_report.pdf) is designed to help anti-doping organisations (ADOs) to develop a framework for their education programmes and provide guidance on how best to monitor and evaluate these programmes. This will help ADOs determine how effective their programmes are, how to improve them, and illustrate the importance of education and prevention within a broader anti-doping programme.
