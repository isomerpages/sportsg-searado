Education Guidelines & Information outline current, accurate, practical information to help protect clean sport and ensure compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code. These documents ensure stakeholders have the information they need, so that they can abide by anti-doping rules and regulations.
##### International Standard for Education (ISE) 
Education, as one prevention strategy highlighted in the Code, seeks to promote behaviour in line with the values of clean sport and to help prevent Athletes and other Persons from doping. 
<br> One key underpinning principles of the ISE is that an Athlete's first experience with anti-doping should be through Education rather than Doping Control.

##### Education and Information Guidelines
[The Guidelines](/files/information-for-stakeholders/educationguideline.pdf) support ADOs in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of an effective core education programme within a broader anti-doping programme that also actively addresses deterrence and detection. Concrete examples are included to put concepts and principles into context. Worksheets and plans help with programme development.

##### Research Package for Anti-Doping Organizations
[The Research Package](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/wada_social_science_research_package_ado.pdf) provides a standardised method of measuring athletes' responses to important issues in anti-doping. This helps assess the effectiveness of education programmes and allows for comparisons between athlete populations around the globe.

##### Overview and Guidance for Applicants to 2023 Social Science Research Grant Program
To support WADAâ€™s research focus, the new WADA Social Science Research Strategy 2020-2024 (SSR Strategy) sets the scene for a new and expanded Social Science Research Program (SSRP) that is more proactive and strategic in its approach. The SSR Strategy prompts us to take a leading role in the social science research agenda as it relates to clean sport, with the aim of maximizing its benefits for WADA stakeholders.
<br>Those wishing to apply for a WADA social science research grant should consult these research priorities, as outlined in this document [[2023 SSR Grant Program Guidance Document]](/files/2023%20SSR%20Grant%20Program%20Guidance%20Document.pdf), to be clear on what research areas WADA is most interested in investing in.

##### A Handbook for the Evaluation of Anti-Doping Education Package
[The Evaluation Handbook](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/houlihan_final_report.pdf) is designed to help anti-doping organisations (ADOs) to develop a framework for their education programmes and provide guidance on how best to monitor and evaluate these programmes. This will help ADOs determine how effective their programmes are, how to improve them, and illustrate the importance of education and prevention within a broader anti-doping programme.
