SEARADO's TUEC must render a decision as soon as possible, and usually within 21 days from the date of receipt of the complete TUE application, including the required medical information.

##### Renewal of TUE
Each TUE has a specific duration, at the end of which it expires automatically. Should you need to continue to use the prohibited substance or method, it is your responsibility to submit a new application for a TUE with updated medical information ahead the expiry date, so that there is sufficient time for a decision to be made prior to the expiry of the current TUE.

**Important note:** The presence (following sample collection), use, possession or administration of the prohibited substance or method shall be consistent with the terms of your TUE. Therefore, if you require a materially different dosage, frequency, route or duration of administration, you should contact SEARADO, as you may be required to apply for a new TUE. Some substances and dosages, e.g., insulin, are often modified during treatment and these possible fluctuations should be mentioned by the treating physician in the TUE application and would usually be accepted by the ADO TUEC. 

##### What if my TUE application is Denied?
A decision to deny a TUE application includes a written explanation of the reason(s) for the denial. If it is not clear to you, please contact SEARADO to understand exactly why the TUE was denied. Sometimes, there may be a critical piece of information, diagnostic test, laboratory results missing, etc. In which case, you should re-apply to us. Otherwise, you may appeal the denial decision as follows: 

**Appeals Involving International-Level Athletes or International Events**: In cases arising from participation in an International Event or in cases involving International-Level Athletes, the decision may be appealed exclusively to Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

**Appeals Involving Other Athletes or Other Persons**: In cases where Article 13.2.1 is not applicable, the decision may be appealed to an appellate body in accordance with rules established by the NADO. The rules for such appeal shall respect the following principles:

- a timely hearing;
- a fair, impartial, and Operationally Independent and Institutionally Independent hearing panel;
- the right to be represented by counsel at the Personâ€™s own expense; and
- a timely, written, reasoned decision.

If no such body as described above is in place and available at the time of the appeal, the Athlete or other Person shall have a right to appeal to CAS.
