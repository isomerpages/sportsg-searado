Athletes may have illnesses or conditions that require them to take medications or undergo procedures. If the medication or method an athlete is required to use to treat an illness or condition is prohibited as per the World Anti-Doping Agencyâ€™s (WADA) [Prohibited List](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list) , a TUE may give that athlete the authorisation to use that substance or method while competing without invoking an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and applicable sanction. Applications for TUEs are evaluated by a panel of physicians the TUE Committee (TUEC).
