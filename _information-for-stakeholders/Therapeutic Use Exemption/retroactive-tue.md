##### You may only apply retroactively for a TUE to your NADO if:

* You required emergency or urgent treatment of a medical condition.
* There was insufficient time, opportunity or other exceptional circumstances that prevented you from submitting the TUE application, or having it evaluated, before getting tested.
* As per your NADO's anti-doping rules you were not permitted or required to apply in advance for a TUE. 
* You are a lower-level athlete who is not under the jurisdiction of an International Federation or National Anti-Doping Organization and were tested.
* You tested positive after using a substance Out-of-Competition that was only prohibited In-Competition (for example glucocorticoids). 

***In rare and exceptional circumstances and notwithstanding any other provision in the ISTUE***, you may apply for and be granted retroactive approval for a therapeutic use of a prohibited substance or method, if considering the purpose of the Code, it would be manifestly unfair not to grant a retroactive TUE.

This unique retroactive TUE will only be granted with the prior approval of WADA (and WADA may in its absolute discretion agree with or reject the your NADOâ€™s decision).

> Important note:
> - Using a prohibited substance or method without a TUE could result in an Anti-Doping Rule Violation.
> - In case an application for a retroactive TUE is necessary following sample collection, you are strongly advised to have a medical file prepared and ready to submit for evaluation.
