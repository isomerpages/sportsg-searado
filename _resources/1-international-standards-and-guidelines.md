#### **International Standards**
The World Anti-Doping Code (Code) works in conjunction with eight International Standards aimed at bringing harmonisation among anti-doping organisations in various technical areas, namely:
- Prohibited List
- Testing and investigations
- Laboratories
- Therapeutic Use Exemptions
- Protection of Privacy and Personal Information
- Code Compliance by Signatories
- Education
- Results Management

*[As regards the International Standard for Laboratories (ISL), the situation is slightly different. The [new version approved in May 2019](https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/isl_nov2019.pdf) will now be reviewed in order to reflect and incorporate any relevant changes into the Standard and to ensure consistency with the other documents that were approved during the World Conference. The amended draft will then be circulated for stakeholder consultation from 10 December 2019 to 4 March 2020; following which, it will be tabled at WADAâ€™s May 2020 ExCo meeting for approval. It will subsequently enter into force on 1 January 2021, along with the revised Code and all other Standards.]*
