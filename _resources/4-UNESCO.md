[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)](https://en.unesco.org/themes/sport-and-anti-doping) is the United Nations’ lead agency for Physical Education and Sport (PES). Assistance and guidance services are provided for governments, NGOs, and experts to debate the evolving challenges of physical education and sport. The organisation also assists and advises Member States wishing to elaborate or strengthen their training system in physical education. And it offers its expertise in the design and implementation of development programmes in the domain of sport.

#### [International Convention against Doping in Sport](https://en.unesco.org/themes/sport-and-anti-doping/convention)
In light of its mandate on education and commitment to the fundamental values underpinning sport, UNESCO has been deeply concerned about the erosion of ethics and the inequity created by the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes.

Entered into force on 1 February 2007 – becoming the most successful convention in the history of UNESCO in terms of the rhythm of ratification after adoption – the Anti-Doping Convention is now the second most ratified of all UNESCO treaties, with 189 States Parties. 

The Convention helps to harmonise anti-doping legislation, guidelines, regulations, and rules internationally in order to provide a fair and equitable playing environment for all athletes. 

#### [Conference of Parties to the International Convention against Doping in Sport, 7th (Paris 2019)](https://en.unesco.org/themes/sport-and-anti-doping/convention/governance)
The Conference of Parties (COP) is the sovereign body of the Convention. It has overall responsibility for its implementation. 

The functions of the COP, as foreseen in Article 30 of the Convention, include: 
- Promotion of the purpose of the Convention; 
- Discussion of the relationship with the World Anti-Doping Agency; 
- Adoption of a plan for the use of the resources of the [Fund for the Elimination of Doping in Sport](https://en.unesco.org/themes/sport-and-anti-doping/fund);
- Examination of the monitoring of compliance with the Convention and the reports submitted by States Parties; and 
- Examination and adoption of any amendments to the Convention

The COP usually meets in ordinary session at UNESCO Headquarters every two years; the meetings of the COP are managed according to its Rules of Procedure. 

In addition to States Parties and other Member States of UNESCO, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is invited as an advisory organisation to the Conference. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), the Council of Europe (CoE), the Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) and other intergovernmental sports organisations are invited as observers.
