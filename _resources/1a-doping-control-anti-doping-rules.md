The World Anti-Doping Code (“WADA Code”) is a document that harmonizes anti-doping regulations across all sports and all countries in the world. It provides a framework for anti-doping programmes and activities, so that all athletes have the benefit of the same anti-doping policies and procedures.

The Southeast Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SEARADO) has established the [SEARADO Anti-Doping Rules](https://www.searado.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEARADO-Rules-2015.pdf) that constitute a legal framework to assist RADO-Member Signatories in governing and managing their anti-doping programmes.

To date, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have established their respective Anti-Doping Rules in accordance with the WADA Code and its International Standards.
