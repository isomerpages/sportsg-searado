The [Anti-Doping Administration & Management System (ADAMS)](https://adams.wada-ama.org/adams/login.do?prompt=true) was developed for this purpose. It is a Web-based database management system that simplifies the daily activities of all stakeholders and athletes involved in the anti-doping system.

#### **ADAMS Function**
##### Athlete Whereabouts
The Web-based functionality allows athletes to comply with the whereabouts rules of their sport by entering their information from anywhere in the world. Additionally, ADAMS supports the delegation of this responsibility to an authorised representative such as team manager, agent or other third party. This functionality also helps Anti-Doping Organisations (ADO) share whereabouts information, crucial for supporting athletes so that they do not need to enter their whereabouts more than once via multiple means. Athletes can also modify their whereabouts through the use of SMS messaging to ADAMS.

The [ADAMS Whereabouts tutorial](https://youtu.be/UmTpHy9oJc8) on how to submit whereabouts information is available on WADA's Youtube channel.

##### TUE Management
ADAMS facilitates online management of TUE requests, as well as online notification to those involved in the process. TUE information is shared with all and only relevant parties, thus for the athlete one submission is all that is necessary. Upon approval of the TUE, ADAMS also provides the athletes the option to print their Certificate of Approval for their records.

##### Test Planning & Results Management
The ADAMS doping control database provided to [ADOs](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/anti-doping-community) is an essential tool for managing both an in- and out-of-competition doping control programme. Stakeholders can use ADAMS to plan, coordinate and order tests, as well as to manage test results. Coordination of doping control programmes in the ADAMS system helps to avoid duplication of testing efforts and harmonises communications between testing authorities, sample collection agencies as well as [WADA-accredited laboratories](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/laboratories).

##### Lab Results Module
WADA-accredited laboratories utilise ADAMS to submit test results to the appropriate authorities including WADA. In this way, Results Management Organisations are notified of results promptly and clearly and WADA is automatically engaged to ensure transparency in all results management processes.

ADAMS was launched in 2005 for the initial pilot phase. The system has since then been introduced and implemented by most ADOs and all WADA accredited anti-doping laboratories.
