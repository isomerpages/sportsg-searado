On 18th February 2020, Mr Gobinathan, DG SEARADO, paid a visit to Brunei and met with key stakeholders in anti-doping. SEARADO is honored to have met Maj Gen (R) Dato Aminuddin Ihsan Abidin, Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports who express his interest and strong support in the fight against doping. In addition, he emphasized the importance on anti-doping and the need to collaborate with the Ministry of Education to promote values-based education.

In addition, DG, SEARADO also paid a visit to the Brunei Darussalam National Olympic Council (BDNOC) where he met and  discussed with Mr Zuraimi Abdul Sani, Secretary General BDNOC. BDNOC strongly supported the efforts by  Brunei Darussalam Anti-Doping Committee (BDADC) and encourage them to apply for the Olympic Solidarity Funding. This was followed by a session with Chairman and members of BDADC, and various topics such as governance, capacity building, testing and education were discussed. This was followed by a meet and greet of volunteers of BDADC.

It is hoped that with all the support, Brunei will have a strong compliance program and in line with the revised Code that kicks in 2021.
