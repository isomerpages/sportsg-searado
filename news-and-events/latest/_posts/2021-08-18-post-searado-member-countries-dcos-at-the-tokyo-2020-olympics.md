A big shout out to all the DCOs from SEARADO Member Countries who were selected to serve at the Tokyo Olympics as International DCOs. It was a great opportunity and unique experience at the Games.<br> Kudos also to our team of DCO Trainers (1st Picture), Ms Nazima Kassim, Ms Irene Tan and Mr Thassana Trairat who also played an instrumental role at the Anti-Doping Command Centre.<br> Sincere thanks to the Japan Anti Doping Agency as well as the Tokyo Organizing Committee for another milestone in collaboration.
