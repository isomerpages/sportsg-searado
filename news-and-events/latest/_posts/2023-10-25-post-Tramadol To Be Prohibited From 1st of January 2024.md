NADOs are to note that Tramadol is prohibited during in-competition from the 1st of January 2024. Used as a painkiller, it is sometimes given together with paracetamol, a common medication.

NADOs are encouraged to pass this information to medical doctors handling athletes as it is important to know of the factors such as its prescription and the washout period.
