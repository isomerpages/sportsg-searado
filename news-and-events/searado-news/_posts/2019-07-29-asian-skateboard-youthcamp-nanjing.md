On 29th July 2019, Mr Gobinathan Nair, DG, SEARADO presented to athletes and coaches participating at the Skateboard Youth Camp in Nanjing, China organized by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and Olympic Solidarity (OS). Apart from an overview of anti-doping, participants had a role play on the actual doping control process which provided them an insight on wat to expect when called upon for a doping control test. Participants were also given an insight on their rights and responsibilities during the test, as well as, in areas of Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) and Results Management (RM).

The presentation ended with all participants taking the Anti-Doping pledge and promising to Play True and Reject Doping.
