Even as COVID-19 restrictions are in place, chance occurred to meet our new Member Country Representative (MCR) from Brunei, Mr Sukardi Kaderi.
Sukardi has been involved in Anti-Doping work for close to 10 years and SEARADO warmly welcome him to the SEARADO Board and look forward to working closely.
