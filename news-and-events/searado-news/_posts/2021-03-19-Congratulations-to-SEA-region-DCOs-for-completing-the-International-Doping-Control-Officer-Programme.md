On 18 and 19 March, SEARADO, in collaboration with the International Testing Agency (ITA), organised the International Doping Control Officer (IDCO) course. 
It was the first IDCO course held in Asia. 

A great informative and interactive session with a good number of case scenarios was discussed and shared. We hope all these DCOs who are headed to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will put in what ever they learned into practice and raise the bar.
