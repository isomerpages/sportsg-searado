SEARADO member countries and JADA had a meeting cum workshop on 26th September in Tokyo, Japan. The main objectives of the meeting was to ensure all member countries are clear with the revised Code and clauses, as well as, to put down all the things that need to be done following the Code revision and new International Standards (IS). The workshop session was done with breakout sessions with member countries sharing their approaches and the challenges.
The key elements of the new IS for Education was also highlighted by Ms Yaya Yamamoto of JADA.

The afternoon session was dedicated to Philippines NADO who will be overseeing the doping control in the upcoming SEA Games. Two groups (one with the focus on testing and the other on education) discussed in detail all that will be done during the Games and staff both from JADA and Tokyo 2020 gave their valuable inputs to ensure everything runs smoothly.
