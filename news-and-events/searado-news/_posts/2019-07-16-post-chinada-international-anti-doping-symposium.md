Representatives of SEARADO member countries attended the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) International Anti-Doping Symposium from 16-17 July 2019 in Beijing, China. The theme of the symposium was Implementing Effective Anti-Doping Programmes in Major Events. The symposium provided a good insight, as well as, practical tools and ideas in running testing and education programs at major games. SEARADO members attending the symposium have surely gain as the information provided has direct relevance in running the SEA Games anti doping programmes.

SEARADO on behalf of all their member countries would like to thank CHINADA for the invitation, as well as, the generous hosting of our members
