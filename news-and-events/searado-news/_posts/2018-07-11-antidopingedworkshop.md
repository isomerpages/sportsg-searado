SEARADO with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and SportSg conducted a 3-day Anti-Doping Education Trainerâ€™s Workshop in Singapore from the 10th to 12th July 2018. 

A total of 41 individuals representing member countries of both South East Asia RADO and South Asia RADO participated in the workshop. Participants were given an insight on the draft International Standard for Education followed by an overview of values-based education and the different approaches adopted by established NADOs. The latter was presented by education experts from JADA, CHINADA, ASADA, USADA, OCEANIA  RADO and SEARADO and stakeholders from Singapore who gave their insights on how they successfully run their Anti-Doping education programs. Participants also had an hands-on by playing the NewMo Activity, a values based activity developed by JADA and also on the VR tool developed by ASADA.

SEARADO hope to follow up and assist with member countries in the development and implementation of their education plans.
