On 25th August 2021, SEARADO hosted a webinar on what NADOs need to know about the Athlete Biological Passport/Athlete Passport Management Unit (ABP/APMU). <br>SEARADO is honoured to have 2 expert guest speakers from World Anti-Doping Agency, Dr. Reid Aikin, Associate Director, Department of Science & Medicine and Dr. Norbert Baume, Manager, Athlete Biological Passport. A first in the region on this topic, relevant and practical information was shared. <br>Key takeaways include the origins of ABP, uses of the ABP, the role of NADOs and relevant stakeholders, how APMU recommendations are used on ADAMS and Case studies. <br>It was certainly a great session for all participants from SEARADO member countries, as well as, our friends from other regions. SEARADO would like to thank Dr. Reid and Dr. Norbert for their effort and time taken to share
