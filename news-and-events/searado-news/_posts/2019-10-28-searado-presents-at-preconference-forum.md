A pre-conference forum was held prior to the COP7 International Convention Against Doping in Sport on 29th October 2019. Topics covered include:
- Artificial Intelligence and Gene Doping;
- Women and Youth Engagement in Sport;
- Values-Based Education & Launch of ‘Sport Values in Every Classroom’ (Toolkit for Teachers); and
- Facilitating Communication for Collaborative Action: Permanent Delegations, NADOs, UNESCO Secretariat.

On the latter discussion, one of the panelists was Mr Gobinathan Nair, DG SEARADO who emphasise the need for various stakeholders to not only communicate with one another but establish a regular platform to update and address matters pertaining to anti-doping.
