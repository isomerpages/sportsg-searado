The visiting entourage had the honour to meet H.E. Mrs Sengdeuane Lachanthabopune who gave her full support in the formation of the Lao-NADO and the plans of putting a new sports law in place and incorporating anti-doping.

This was followed by the visiting team having two full days of discussion with officials with regards to the details in the formation of the new NADO. In addition, the critical and high priority areas under the Critical Action Report was discussed.

It was a very fruitful session and SEARADO would like to thank the Doping Control Authority of Thailand (DCAT) for their magnanimity in assisting a member country in their anti-doping efforts.
