SEARADO hosted a webinar on DCO Management, Monitoring and Evaluation on 15th July 2021. <br>Guest speakers include Mr Michael Harkins, Director, Anti-Doping Testing, Sport Integrity Australia and Mr Jaekwon Lee, Testing Department Manager, 한국도핑방지위원회 - Korea Anti-Doping Agency. 
<br>There were great takeaways from the speakers including having guidelines/manual booklets readily accessible by DCOs, using the opportunity of COVID-19 lockdown to create more training sessions for DCOs, and exploring the creation of a software application like Anti-Doping Task Integration System (ADTIS) to manage DCOs. <br>It was a great session for all participants from SEARADO member countries, as well as our friends from other RADOs, and SARADO member countries. SEARADO would like to thank KADA and Sports Integrity Australia and look forward to more collaborations.
