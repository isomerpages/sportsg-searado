DG SEARADO visited Cambodia Anti Doping Agency (CADA) on the 19-20th December 2018.  Discussions were held with CADA staff and key stakeholders on governance, organisational re-structuring, education, testing and discussing critical and high priority pointers in the Corrective Action Report of CADA.

SEARADO would like to thank CADA and their key stakeholders for their contributions and work done this far as well as their commitment to improve in the various areas of anti doping.
