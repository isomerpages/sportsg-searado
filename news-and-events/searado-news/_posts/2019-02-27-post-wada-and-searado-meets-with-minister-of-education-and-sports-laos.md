On 27th February, Mr Kazuhiro Hayashi, Director, World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Asia/Oceania Office and Mr Gobinathan Nair, Director-General, South East Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organisation (SEARADO) paid a courtesy call to Laos and Mrs. Sengdeuane Lachanthaboune, Minister of Education and Sport, Mr Kasem Inthara, Vice President of Lao Olympic Committee, Dr Southanom Inthavong, Director-General of Lao NOC and other senior officials  to discuss on the move forward in anti doping in Laos.

Mrs Lachanthaboune and her team gave their commitment to support anti-doping and the intention for Laos to set up a NADO as soon as possible. Both WADA and SEARADO assured their full support in ensuring the Lao NADO is given the necessary support and resources to build the NADO. In addition, a tripartite collaboration among SEARADO, Lao-NADO and the Doping Control Authority of Thailand (DCAT) will be further explored.
