On 8th October, Mr Gobinathan Nair, DG SEARADO together with Dr Alex Pineda, Head, Philippine National Anti-Doping Organisation (Phi-NADO), spearheaded a strategic planning session with the staff of Phi-NADO. Staff were led to a step by step approach to create a Vision, Mission, Values and Strategic Thrusts. For the latter, the staff had earlier individually provided their inputs on a SWOT Analysis which was analysed together as a group in identifying the strategic thrusts and objectives.

A great time ahead for Phi-NADO and we look forward to all key stakeholders support
