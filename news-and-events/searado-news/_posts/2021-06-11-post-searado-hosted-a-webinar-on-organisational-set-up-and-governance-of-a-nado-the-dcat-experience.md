SEARADO hosted a webinar on Organisational Set-Up and Governance of a NADO: The DCAT Experience. <br>SEARADO is honoured to have Dr. Hilary Inwood, Director, DCAT and SEARADO Board Member to share his experience from the history of anti-doping in Thailand to the set-up of the DCAT Doping Control Agency of Thailand (DCAT), as well as, the introduction of anti-doping legislation and the establishment of a governing Board. <br>Great tips were shared on the ‘challenges’ faced and the possible approaches and solutions. It was a great session for all participants from SEARADO member countries, government officials, as well as, our friends from SARADO.
