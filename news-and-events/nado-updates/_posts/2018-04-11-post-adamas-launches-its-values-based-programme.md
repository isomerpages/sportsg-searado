The main objectives of the programme is two-fold: first, to imbibe and inculcate values in athletes at an early age; and in doing so, create a strong and stable anti-doping culture and creating the Real Champion

The Real Champion programme was introduced by the Japan Anti-Doping Agency (JADA) as one of the [“PLAY TRUE 2020” projects](http://playtrue2020-sp4t.jp/) and it was adopted and modified incorporating Teambuilding activities that promote values. In addition, were provided information pertaining  anti doping and the use of supplements.

The programme was held from 12- 14th April 2018 in Trolak, Perak and was attended by 80 students and 8 coaches from seven  National and State Sports schools. Feedback indicated that the participants not only enjoyed the programme but had good take home messages.
