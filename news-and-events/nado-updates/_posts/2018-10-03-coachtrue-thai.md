The Anti Doping e-learning (ADeL)  platform of WADA offers the Coach True e-learning for coaches and support personnel. The Coach True was translated into 5 languages in the Southeast Asian region. One of the languages was in Thai and it was recently launched at the Thailand’s Sports Hero Games. The Sports Hero Games is Thailand’s regional competition. The main objective of the Games is to scout for talented young athletes from all over the country. The 2nd Sports Hero Games was held from 29 to 31 August 2018 in Chonburi, Thailand.

During this competition, Doping Control Agency of Thailand (DCAT) has focused on the implementation of the Coach True (Thai) for regional coaches who are involved in the sports of  boxing, muay thai and weightlifting. About 40 coaches enthusiastically tried out the Coach True and ultimately DCAT hopes to reach coaches of other sports soon.
