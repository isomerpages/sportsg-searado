The Anti-Doping Agency of Malaysia (ADAMAS) conducted a DCO Refresher course for 46 DCOs.  In  Malaysia, it is a requirement for all active DCO’s to attend a Refresher Course once in 2years for them to maintain their DCO accreditation. The main facilitators for the Refresher Course was Mr Nishel Kumar and Ms Nazima Kassim.  Testing procedures were revised and clarifications were sought.  DCO’s were also highlighted on the key pointers in the report put up the SEARADO Trainers at the recent SEA Games. On the whole, the session not only achieved it’s objective but provided the DCO’s a platform to share.
