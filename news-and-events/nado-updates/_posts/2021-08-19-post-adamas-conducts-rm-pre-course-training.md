RM members from Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia were also invited. Various aspects of anti-doping were covered to provide RM members an overview of anti-doping. <br>Day 1 of the pre-course includes background information on education, testing, TUEs and results management. <br>Day 2 of the pre-course covered aspects of adjudication and case studies. Following the pre-course, participants will attend a formal RM course. 
Well done Anti-Doping Malaysia!
