On the 8th of September 2023, SEARADO facilitated a sharing session by Mr. Nima Gyeltshen  from the Bhutan Anti Doping Committee (BADC) to the Timor-Leste Anti Doping (TLAD) Team on Bhutanâ€™s recent experience and learning points in studying and analysing the possible options in the set up of an operationally independent NADO as part of their UNESCO Fund for the Elimination of Doping.  

SEARADO would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Nima for his sharing.
