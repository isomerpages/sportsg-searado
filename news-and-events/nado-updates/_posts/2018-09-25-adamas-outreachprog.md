The 19th Malaysia Games (known as SUKMA) 2018 was held from 12th to 22nd September 2018 in Perak, Malaysia. 15 states/contingents including Brunei participated in the Games where athletes competed in 29 sports involving 427 events.

Anti-Doping Agency of Malaysia (ADAMAS) took the opportunity to reach out to the youth athletes and their entourage through an  Outreach programme which was held from 15th to 20th September at the main venue in Ipoh. The mobile outreach booth moved over various sports venues covering the sports of Athletics, Aquatics, Badminton, Basketball, Cycling, Cricket, Gymnastics, Hockey, Lawn Bowls, Rugby, Shooting, Squash and Weightlifting.

At the booth, athletes and support personnel had a chance to try out the “PLAY TRUE” quiz and the level 1&2 Real Champion quiz adapted from the JADA’s Education Package. Those achieving a minimum score of 70% was rewarded with a gift. In total over 300 Athletes and close to 100 support personnel took part in the Outreach.  Apart from the Quiz, it provided us a great opportunity to interact with the athletes and entourage and highlight to them the various anti doping programmes and clear their doubts on various queries that they posed.
