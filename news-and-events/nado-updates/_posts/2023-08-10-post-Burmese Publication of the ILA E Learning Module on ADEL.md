The International Level Athletes (ILA) e-learning module in Burmese has been published on ADEL. Thanks to the efforts of all at Myanmar Anti-Doping Organization (MADO) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Education Department. All the hard work and coordination are much appreciated.  
If a learner would like to do the ILA Burmese e-learning module, it is also available in the Athletes Education Catalog on the main ADEL landing page.
