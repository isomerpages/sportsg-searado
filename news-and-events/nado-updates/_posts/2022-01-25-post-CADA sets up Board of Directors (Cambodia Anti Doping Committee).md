SEARADO congratulates Cambodia Anti-Doping Agency (CADA) and stakeholders in setting up a Board of Directors (Cambodia Anti Doping Committee) signed by the Prime Minister on 28th Dec 2021. This will create the independence expected from the Code. A meeting was held with reps from CADA, SEARADO and WADA Regional Office to discuss on the new set up moving forward.
