On 20th September, SEARADO met with the Testing co-ordinators of Tier 4 member countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Timor-Leste) to highlight various administrative aspects involving the Testing Grant, as well as, technical aspects like Risk Assessment, Test Distribution Plan and ADAMS.

SEARADO extends our appreciation to all the testing co-ordinators for their hard work and keeping up with all the requirements.
