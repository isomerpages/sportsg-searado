SEARADO would like to thank all Member Country National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADOs) in their efforts to ensure that all athletes who headed for the recent Asian Games have done their ADEL e-learning module for International Level Athletes. 

You may refer to this [article from the Olympic Council of Asia](https://ocasia.org/news/4354-ocas-bid-to-champion-clean-sport-produces-positive-results-in-hangzhou.html) which reflects the Council's aim to champion clean sport. As the Director General of SEARADO, Gobinathan Nair, who is also a member of OCA's Anti-Doping Commission said on the article, "We wanted the athletes' first experience of anti-doping to be with education rather than doping control."
