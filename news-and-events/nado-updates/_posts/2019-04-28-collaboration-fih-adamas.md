In the recent conclusion of the FIH Series Finals in Malaysia, FIH had a collaboration with ADAMAS in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. With an attendance of 115 athletes and 8 support personnel, FIH and ADAMAS was able to educate and raise the awareness on anti-doping issues and offences.

A kiosk was set up for 2 days to raise awareness on these issues. Participants then took part in a quiz and scored well with 95-97% scoring 7 and above out of 10 which shows good knowledge of anti-doping awareness.

FIH looks forward to continue promoting athletes voices and help them engage in the Clean Hockey conversation. FIH are looking to set up an outreach booth in collaboration with JADA in Hiroshima at the FIH Series Finals to introduce and educate athletes on what anti-doping is by FIH athletes. As well as one in Amsterdam during the pro league grand final in partnership with Doping Authority Netherlands.

FIH hopes that these education booths will provide necessary information about the consequences in doping to athletes, coaches and officials.
