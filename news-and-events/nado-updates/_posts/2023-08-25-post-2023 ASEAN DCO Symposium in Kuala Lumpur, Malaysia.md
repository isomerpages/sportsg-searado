SEARADO applauds Anti-Doping Agency of Malaysia (ADAMAS) for a its successful holding of the 2023 ASEAN DCO+ Symposium as well as their great hospitality. SEARADO would also like to thank the Kementerian Belia dan Sukan (KBS) for the great support given.

It is hope that such a symposium for DCOs will be held regularly for DCOs to be kept abreast with the latest information and an opportunity to meet and share with DCOs in the region.
