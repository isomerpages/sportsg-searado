<br>SEARADO presented to both Lembaga Anti-Doping Indonesia (LADI) and Vietnam Anti-Doping Agency (VADA) on developing Risk Assessment (RA) and Test Distribution Plan (TDP) for Out-of-Competition Testing (OOCT). This was followed up by a presentation on Education Planning. It is hope that member countries got a good insight in both these areas and SEARADO look forward to reviewing the NADOs submissions. We thank all effort put in by both NADOs.
