As part of the Agreement signed among SEARADO, Doping Control Agency of Thailand (DCAT) and Lao National Anti-Doping Organisation (Lao-NADO), six (6) staff of the newly formed Lao-NADO visited DCAT and over a few days were given a good insight on the organisational structure, roles of the different teams and individuals in testing, education etc. In addition, an Action Plan was put in place to further assist Lao-NADO to come to speed on all matters pertaining anti-doping. 

Kudos to Lao-NADO for their enthusiasm and DCAT for all the time and effort in hosting and guiding Lao-NADO. SEARADO look forward more of such collaborations in the region
