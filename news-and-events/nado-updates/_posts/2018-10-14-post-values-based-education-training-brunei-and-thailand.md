Following the Anti Doping Education Trainer’s workshop in Singapore, staff of DCAT and BDADC were selected to visit JADA’s office to have a further in depth discussion on the approach of values based education that is developed and implemented by JADA. The education experts from both member countries got a good insight of the approach and how they would be able to customize it to their local needs.

Ms Luksamon (DCAT) had an enriching experience. She had a constructive session where she was able to discuss and tackle their challenges and coming up with strategies in place.  There were plans to target the National Federations (NFs) and create education plans for the short and long term goals for different target groups. They would also educate their DCAT staff in the use of e-learning materials. She would like to express her thanks and appreciation to JADA, SEARADO and WADA to help DCAT on Thailand’s Values-Based Education Program.

Here is what Mr Sukardi (BDAC) has said: ” It was a great experience in Japan as I gained more detail on the Values-Based Education Program. In addition, we also discussed on the way forward for BDADC’S Education Program in Brunei Darussalam for short, mid and long term which includes the introduction of Values-Based Education in schools. I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation on the opportunities given and continuous support from JADA, SEARADO and WADA for Brunei Darussalam in Anti-Doping Program.”
