#### **What happens if the 'A' Sample produces a positive result?**
If there is an AAF on the A sample, the ADO responsible for results management will conduct an initial review to verify if the athlete has a valid [Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE)] for the substance found in the sample, and to ensure that sample collection and analysis was conducted according to procedures.

If the initial review does not justify the AAF, the athlete will be notified in writing of the:
-  Sample analysis results
-  Possible consequences
-  Right to have the B sample analysed
-  Right to attend or appoint a representative to attend the analysis of the B sample

At this point, the athlete may be provisionally suspended according to the rules of the ADO.

#### **What happens if the 'B' Sample result confirms the 'A' Sample result?**
If the B Sample analysis confirms the adverse analytical finding in respect of the A Sample, then the matter shall proceed to a hearing by an independent anti-doping disciplinary panel. An athlete that is charged with an anti-doping rule violation has the right to a fair hearing.

The hearing process will address whether an anti-doping rule violation was committed and, if so, the appropriate consequences according to the anti-doping rules of the ADO.
