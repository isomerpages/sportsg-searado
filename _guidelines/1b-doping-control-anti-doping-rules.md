The World Anti-Doping Code (“WADA Code”) is a document that harmonizes anti-doping regulations across all sports and all countries in the world. It provides a framework for anti-doping programmes and activities, so that all athletes have the benefit of the same anti-doping policies and procedures.

The Southeast Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SEARADO) has established the [SEARADO Anti-Doping Rules](https://www.searado.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEARADO-Rules-2015.pdf) that constitute a legal framework to assist RADO-Member Signatories in governing and managing their anti-doping programmes.

To date, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have established their respective Anti-Doping Rules in accordance with the WADA Code and its International Standards.

#### **What is Doping?**
There are ten ways in which athletes and athlete support personnel can violate the WADA Code:

1. Presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s sample
2. Use or attempted use of a prohibited substance or method
3. Evading, refusing or failing to submit to sample collection by an athlete
4. Whereabouts failures by an athlete
5. Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of the doping control by an athlete or other person
6. Possession of a prohibited substance or prohibited method 
7. Trafficking or attempted trafficking in any prohibited substance or prohibited method
8. Administering or attempting to administer a prohibited substance or method to an athlete, or to assist, encourage, aid, abet or cover up an anti-doping rule violation
9. Complicity or attempted complicity by an athlete or other person
10. Prohibited association by an athlete or other person 
11. Acts by an athlete or other persons to discourage or retaliate against reporting to authorities

#### **What is Doping Control?**
Doping Control or Testing is central to the fight against doping in sport. Athletes associated with a National Sports Federation and those competing at the international and/or national level can be tested at anytime and anywhere – during training, in competition, at home or at any other venues – by the respective International Federation, National Anti-Doping Organization or a Major Event Organizing Committee. 

Refusing to be tested could result in a ban from sport, so compliance is mandatory if selected. Athletes can be asked to provide both urine and blood samples, and specially trained and accredited doping control personnel will observe the athlete at all times, including when providing the sample.

**In-Competition Testing**

Only one anti-doping organization shall conduct testing at an event. In-competition testing commence 12 hours before a competition in which the athlete is scheduled to participate though the end of the competition and the sample collection process related to the competition. Athletes can be chosen by random selection, finishing position or by being selected for a particular reason.

**Out-of-Competition Testing**

Out-of-competition, or testing done outside of an event, can be conducted at any time and at any place. Out-of-Competition means any period which is not In-Compeition.

#### **Testing Advice**
Testing is part of being an elite athlete. Those undergoing testing for the first time may find it intimidating. Below are some useful tips to help athletes be prepared:

- Know the sample collection procedures
- Know rights and responsibilities of an athlete
- Always carry photographic identification
- Ask for an interpreter if necessary
- Have a representative to accompany, especially for first-timers undergoing the procedure
- Do not drink too much fluid so that the urine sample is not too diluted
- Request for more information about the procedures if unsure
- Keep a list of medications and supplements consumed to ensure that information is accurately recorded on the doping control form
- Keep a copy of the doping control form
