#### **About Results Management**
The anti-doping organization (ADO) that initiated sample collection is responsible for results management.

The WADA-accredited laboratory that analyzes the A sample will report the results to the ADO responsible for results management and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

##### There are three possible results:
**A Negative Result** – No presence of prohibited substances or methods

**An Atypical Finding** – Some prohibited substances are produced naturally in the body (endogenous). The presence of such substances outside what is considered to be a normal range in the A sample may result in the laboratory reporting an atypical finding.

**An Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF)** – The presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers (including elevated quantities of endogenous substances) or evidence of the use of a prohibited method.

#### **What happens if the 'A' Sample produces a positive result?**
If there is an AAF on the A sample, the ADO responsible for results management will conduct an initial review to verify if the athlete has a valid [Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE)] for the substance found in the sample, and to ensure that sample collection and analysis was conducted according to procedures.

If the initial review does not justify the AAF, the athlete will be notified in writing of the:
-  Sample analysis results
-  Possible consequences
-  Right to have the B sample analysed
-  Right to attend or appoint a representative to attend the analysis of the B sample

At this point, the athlete may be provisionally suspended according to the rules of the ADO.
