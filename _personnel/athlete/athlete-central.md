The "Athlete Central" is an App launched by WADA in November 2019. Athlete Central will help with facilitating athlete compliance with Whereabouts rules under the global anti-doping programme.

Powered by ADAMS, the new Athlete Central is a simple, smart and reliable way for athletes to provide their Whereabouts information in order to support Out-of-Competition Testing (OOCT) and demonstrate their commitment to clean sport. Its attributes include:

- Smart App for improved accuracy
- Location-based address recommendations
- Intuitive user Interface requiring less support &amp; training
- Supports all types of Whereabout pool, including RTPs
- Improved adherence to International Standards for Testing and Investigations (ISTI)
- A dedicated Help Desk
