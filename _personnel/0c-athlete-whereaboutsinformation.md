Athletes are role models and they have an important responsibility to protect the integrity of their sport. Providing whereabouts is about protecting the athlete’s right to clean sport. Providing complete, current and accurate whereabouts information allows the Anti-Doping Organisation (ADO) to locate the athlete with no advance notice to test athletes who choose to cheat themselves by doping.

Athletes who fail to comply with the athlete whereabouts information requirements may incur anti-doping rule violations and subsequent sanctions.

> All Registered Testing Pool athletes are advised to refer to their respective NADO or IF Anti-Doping Rules for details of their whereabouts obligations.

#### **Who is Required to Provide Whereabouts Information**
Athletes who have been identified for inclusion in their respective NADO or IF Registered Testing Pool (RTP) are required to provide accurate and timely whereabouts filing directly to their NADO or IF. Each athlete in a RTP will be notified in writing, of their inclusion in the RTP and the specific whereabouts filing requirements and consequences for non-compliance.

**International RTP**

An international RTP, established by an IF, will generally include athletes who compete regularly at the highest level of international competition eg, Olympic, Paralympic or World Championship, as determined by rankings or other suitable criteria.

**National RTP**

A national RTP, established by a NADO, will generally include:
1. Athletes over which a NADO has jurisdiction that have been included in an international RTP.
2. Athletes who are part of national teams in Olympic or Paralympic or other sports of high national priority (or who might be selected for such teams).
3. Athletes who train independently but perform at Olympic / Paralympic or World Championship level and may be selected for such event.

All athletes in a RTP must submit whereabouts filing to their NADO or IF until the athlete is informed otherwise.

#### **What Whereabouts Information is Required?**
Daily whereabouts information is required for each day of the following quarter, even if the athlete is travelling, or competing, or on holiday, or on any other day. The daily whereabouts information required for each quarter are:

**1. Address and Contact Details**

Such as: 
- Home Address
- Contact phone numbers
- Email address

**2. Overnight Address**

The full address of the place where the athlete will be residing, that is, sleeping overnight.

**3. 60-minute Timeslot**

One specific 60-minute timeslot between 5am and 11pm each day were the athlete will be available and accessible for testing at a specific location.

**4. Compeition Scedules and Locations**

The name and address of each competition location where the athlete is scheduled to compete during the quarter and the date(s) on which the athlete is competing at these locations.

**5. Information and Locations of Training and Other Regular Activities**

The dates, timeframes, name and address of each location where the athlete will train or conduct other regular activity (eg, school or work).

**6. Level of Athlete**
- International Athlete
- National Athlete
- Recreational Athlete/Others

> All athletes can still be tested anytime and anywhere even if they have not been included in a Registered Testing Pool.

#### **Whereabouts Failures**
It is the responsibility of RTP athletes to ensure that their whereabouts information is kept updated and accurate at all times.

**Missed Test**

If an athlete is unavailable for testing when an anti-doping organisation attempts to test them during the specific 60-minute timeslot provided by the athlete, then a Missed Test may be pursued.

**Filing Failure**

If an athlete fails to provide and update the required whereabouts information, then a Filing Failure may be pursued.

>>Any combination of 3 Missed Test(s) and/or Filing Failure(s) within an 12-month period will constitute an anti-doping rule violation. The period of sanction is between 1 to 2 years, depending on the athlete’s degree of fault.

#### **When are Athletes Required to Submite Whereabouts Information?**
Athletes included into their NADO or IF RTP are required to provide a whereabouts filing on a quarterly basis (i.e. every 3 months) and to update this information, as required, to maintain its accuracy.

Athletes must ensure their quarterly whereabouts filing is received by their NADO or IF before the start of each quarter by the deadline specified.

#### **Delegation of Whereabouts Filing Responsibilities**
The athlete may choose to delegate some or all whereabouts filing to a third party representative, such as a coach, team manager, or National Sports Federation, provided that the third party agrees to this delegation. It is still the athlete’s responsibility to ensure that their whereabouts information is accurate even though their whereabouts information are filed by their authorised representative.

#### **How do Athletes Submite and Update Whereabouts Information?**
Anti-Doping Organizations are encouraged to use the World Anti-Doping Agency’s online [Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS)](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/adams) for the management and sharing of athlete whereabouts information.

Using ADAMS is free, easy to use and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. Watch the following video on how to use ADAMS for whereabouts submissions.

If the NADO or IF is using ADAMS for whereabouts, athletes will be provided a personal ADAMS username and password, and are strongly advised against giving their ADAMS log-in information to anyone, as the athlete is accountable for any actions completed following the login.

If the athlete chooses to delegate an authorised representative to assist with their whereabouts filing, a separate ADAMS username and password and access to the athlete’s ADAMS account will be provided to the representative.

> Athletes alone are responsible for their whereabouts. They cannot blame their representative for inaccurately filing or forgetting to update the athlete’s whereabouts.
